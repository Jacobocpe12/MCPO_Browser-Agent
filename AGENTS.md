# Repository Guidelines

- Prefer descriptive commit messages summarizing the functional change.
- Keep Docker- and FastAPI-related code readable with clear comments when behavior is non-obvious.
- When adding Python files in `webui-mcp-stack/mcpo`, follow standard PEP 8 formatting and document any background jobs.
- Update the README whenever new runtime features or endpoints are introduced.
